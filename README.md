# Titanic-random-forest-grid-search
Titanic challenge part 2 In this kernel, we will be covering all of the steps required to train, tune and assess a random forest model.  Part 1 of this series dealt with the pre-processing and manipulation of the data. This notebook will make use of the data sets that were created in the first part.  We will do each of the following:  train and test default RF model introduce cross-validation for model training use grid search to optimize hyperparameters submit our predictions for the test set Part 3 of this challenge involves fitting and tuning a neural network to make predictions.
